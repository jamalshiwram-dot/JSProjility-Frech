The previous AI engineer initiated development of JS Projility, a full-stack project management application (React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB). The core functionality included project creation, budget tracking, and basic timeline views. Initial tasks focused on establishing this foundation and addressing numerous Vercel deployment issues related to  and  version conflicts, which were meticulously resolved through GitHub file edits and Vercel build command overrides, including managing GitHub author discrepancies with Vercel deployments.

Subsequent development systematically added key features: a project lifecycle stage management dropdown, comprehensive resource management with automatic expense tracking (including vendors, equipment, and materials), and bidirectional synchronization between resources and expenses (CRUD operations). Further enhancements included an interactive timeline view with progress tracking, overdue indicators, and a dedicated timeline manager for editing project dates and adding milestones. The milestone system was then expanded with bidirectional synchronization, validation for dates, and currently, comprehensive editing capabilities within both the Milestones tab and Timeline Manager, including optional resource assignment. Throughout, the AI engineer showed diligence in testing via screenshots and a testing agent, consistently addressing bugs and refining features as requested.

<product_requirements>
The primary goal is to build a full-stack project management application, initially named PM Central and later rebranded to JS Projility. This application should facilitate project managers in tracking various aspects of project lifecycles.

**Core Features (Initial Build):**
-   **Project Creation:** Ability to create new projects with details like Name, Description, Start Date, End Date, and Budget.
-   **Dashboard Overview:** Display key project metrics (Total, Active, Expenses, Overdue Milestones).
-   **Project Detail View:** Dedicated page for each project showing:
    -   Budget Overview (Total, Spent, Remaining).
    -   Timeline (Start/End Date, Duration).
    -   Progress (Total Milestones, Completed, Rate).
    -   Tabs for Overview, Resources, Milestones, Expenses, Documents.

**Implemented Enhancements:**
-   **Project Stage Management:** A dropdown menu on the project detail page to move projects through lifecycle stages: Initiation, Planning, Execution, Monitoring, Closing, and Closed. Each stage has a color-coded badge.
-   **Resource Management:**
    -   Ability to add, edit, and delete resources (Team Members, Vendors, Equipment, Materials) from the Resources tab.
    -   Optional cost and quantity fields for Vendors, Equipment, and Materials, which automatically create corresponding entries in the Expenses tab.
    -   Bidirectional synchronization: Deleting a linked expense also deletes its resource; editing a linked expense updates the resource; linking an expense to a resource creates that resource.
-   **Timeline & Milestone Management:**
    -   Enhanced timeline view showing Days until Project Completion (red when within 10% of end date or overdue).
    -   Interactive Timeline card opens a detailed Timeline Manager to update project start/end dates and manage milestones.
    -   Date validation: Project End Date must be after Start Date; Milestone Due Dates must be within Project Start/End Dates.
    -   Bidirectional synchronization: Milestones added/edited in the Timeline Manager are reflected in the Milestones tab, and vice-versa.
    -   Milestones can be edited from both the Milestones tab and the Timeline Manager with a detailed popup, including optional resource assignment.
-   **Expense Management:**
    -   Ability to manually add, edit, and delete expenses from the Expenses tab, with an option to link them to resources, which then auto-creates the resource.
    -   Automatic updates to budget overview when expenses are added/modified/deleted.
</product_requirements>

</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with clear separation of concerns:



-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: This is the main FastAPI application file, hosting all backend logic, API endpoints, and MongoDB interactions. It defines data models using Pydantic, handles CRUD operations for projects, resources, expenses, and milestones, and manages inter-resource relationships (e.g., auto-creating expenses from resources, syncing resources with expenses).
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Initial setup for projects, resources, expenses, milestones.
        -   Addition of  field and corresponding update endpoint.
        -   Endpoints for resource creation (), update (), and deletion ().
        -   Logic for automatically creating expenses when 'equipment', 'materials', or 'vendors' with costs are added as resources.
        -   Logic for bidirectional synchronization: when a linked expense is deleted, the associated resource is also deleted; when a linked expense is edited, the resource details are updated.
        -   Endpoints for creating expenses (), updates (), and deletion (), including logic for linking to resources.
        -   Endpoints for milestone creation (), update (), and deletion ().
        -   Logic for milestone completion/uncompletion.
        -   Endpoint for project timeline updates.
        -   Resource assignment to milestones.
        -   Updated  and  models with additional fields for features.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: This is the main React component, serving as the application's entry point. It manages global state, routing, data fetching from the FastAPI backend, and renders all UI components, including the dashboard, project creation forms, and detailed project views. It extensively uses Shadcn UI components.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Initial dashboard and project detail page structure.
        -    for new projects.
        -    component enhanced with tabs (Overview, Resources, Milestones, Expenses, Documents).

        -    and display logic in the Resources tab, including conditional cost fields.
        -    and  functionality.
        -    in the Expenses tab, with  checkbox and conditional resource creation.
        -    and  functionality, with bidirectional sync logic.
        -   Enhanced  with progress visualization, overdue indicators, and Click to Manage functionality.
        -    dialog for updating project dates and managing milestones, including date validation and a save/reset mechanism.
        -    for adding milestones in the Milestones tab.
        -    component for comprehensive milestone editing, including resource assignment, and displaying details.
        -   Global state management (using  and ) to ensure UI updates reflect backend changes.
        -   Imported and utilized various Shadcn UI components like , , , , , , , etc.
        -   Added  attributes for various interactive elements.

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: This file contains the global and component-specific styles for the React frontend. It uses Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling and includes custom styles for elements not covered by Shadcn defaults.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Defined  font for modern typography.
        -   Custom scrollbars and animations.
        -   Responsive design breakpoints.
        -   Professional color scheme and hover effects for interactive elements.
        -   Specific styling for progress bars, status badges, and overdue indicators (e.g., red color for overdue projects/milestones).

-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Manages Node.js dependencies for the React frontend.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Downgraded  from  to  to resolve dependency conflicts.
        -   Downgraded  and  from  to  for  compatibility.

The UI components from  are consistently used for consistency and modern design.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on enhancing the milestone management feature. The user requested the ability to edit existing milestones within the Milestones tab, with all changes (including name and due date) synchronizing to the Timeline overview. Additionally, when clicking on a milestone, a popup window showing its details should appear, allowing for edits and the optional assignment of a resource to that milestone. An edit button should also be present in the timeline overview when managing milestones.

The AI engineer has implemented:
-   Backend endpoints to support milestone updates and resource assignment to milestones.
-   A new  React component to handle the detailed view and editing of a milestone, including a dropdown for optional resource assignment.
-   Frontend modifications in  to manage the state and handlers for milestone editing.
-   Updates to the Milestones tab to include Edit buttons for each milestone and make milestones clickable to open the detail/edit dialog.
-   Updates to the  component to also include Edit buttons for milestones displayed within the timeline overview.
-   Fixed a critical syntax error where the  component was declared twice, leading to application crashes.

Current state: The enhanced milestone management feature, including editing, detail views, and optional resource assignment, appears to be working based on the latest tests. The dashboard shows project progress and milestones correctly, and the milestone detail/edit dialog opens with pre-populated data and allows resource assignment.

<optional_next_step>
Test the enhanced milestone management comprehensively, ensuring all edits and resource assignments sync bidirectionally.
