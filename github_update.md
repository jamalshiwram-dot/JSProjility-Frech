# Fixed Issues for JS Projility Vercel Deployment

## Issues Fixed:
1. Added null checking for projects array to prevent .map() errors
2. Added fallback for REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL environment variable
3. Improved error handling in fetchProjects function
4. Added empty state message when no projects exist

## Changes Made:
- Fixed App.js line 144 error with proper array checking
- Added fallback backend URL for when environment variable is missing
- Better error handling and logging

These changes should resolve the blank page issue in Vercel deployment.
